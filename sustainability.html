Droughts, floods, and storms have become more common than before. Various reforms include a more proper management of water usage and its impact on the environment, flood and storm management, and government policies to control water management.</h3>

                    <h3>Scientists had already come up with filtering salt from ocean water, treating wastewater, and drilling for groundwater. While these aquifers are used in many places, they are running out faster than they are being filled, so they are not long-term solutions. Many long-term solutions require a lot of power, so without efficient and reliable power sources, water cannot be treated as reliably. Some places consider a solar-powered desalination plant the best option for water treatment.</h3>
