                    <h1>What have people done in the past when treating water?</h1>
                    <h3>Most ancient civilizations knew that exposing contaminated water to sunlight will evaporate the water and the impurities are (most likely) left behind. While it is evaporating, they would collect the water vapor and condense it back to clean water.</h3>
                    <h3>Other times, they would transport water from a clean source (e.g. a lake) to an area. Aqueducts, water tunnels, and some canals were made for this purpose.</h3>

                    <h1>How is water managed today?</h1>
                    <h3>As the human population grows, there is an increase in demand for water, as supplies dwindle due to climate change. Current methods include regulations of water usage and treatment. More information is available on the <a href="sustainability.html">Sustainability</a> page.</h3>
