                    <h3>Most ancient civilizations knew that exposing contaminated water to sunlight will evaporate away the water and the impurities are (most likely) left behind. As the water evaporates, they would collect the water vapor and condense it back to clean water.</h3>
                    <h3>Other times, they would carry transport water from a reliable source (like a lake) to an area. Aqueducts, water tunnels, and some canals were made for this purpose.</h3>
