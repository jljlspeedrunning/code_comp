# Project Description:
This project is a work of process for the upcoming submission of HackYoung Olympiad.

Please don't change or remove images, this README.md file, or unnecessary files. Thank you.

Please only view the html code in 1920:1080, as any other resolution may not show the intended content.

## Recommendations:
If you want to use python code in any HTML file, add the tags \<script src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script> and \<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css"> inside the \<head> tag (if not already there), and add a \<py-script></py-script> wherever you want the code to be run in and put your python code inside it.

Use the "assets" folder to put in files that the HTML depends on. Like if you have a python file to run with your pyscript, you can put that file here.

Use the "resources" folder to put in files like images, videos, or audio files.
