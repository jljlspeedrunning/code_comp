# Project Description:
This project is a work of process for the upcoming submission of HackYoung Olympiad. You can view an HTML file with a web browser, but make sure to download the file first, as it is the recommended method.

Please don't change or remove images, this README.md file, or unnecessary files. Thank you.

Please only view the html code in 1920:1080, as any other resolution may not show the intended content.

## Recommendations
If you want to use python code in any HTML file, add the tags \<script src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js">\</script> and \<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css"> inside the \<head> tag (if not already there), and add a \<py-script>\</py-script> wherever you want the code to be run in and put your python code inside it. MAKE SURE TO RESEARCH THOROUGHLY ON THIS, THOUGH.

Use the "assets" folder to put in files that the HTML depends on. Like if you have a python file to run with your pyscript, you can put that file here.

Use the "resources" folder to put in files like images, videos, or audio files. Don't mess with any of the files here unless you know what you are doing.

## Project Format
- The main page "index.html" is where I put general information of water sanitation (already completed).
- Activities page "activities.html" is where I put recommended activities for conserving water. You can put minigames there as well (with Python and pyscript).
- Management page "management.html" is where I put how people have previously, and are still, using water, and how they are being conserved right now.
- Sustainability page "sustainability.html" is where the info about the sustainability of water goes.
- **Images can only be from the public domain. Before you start adding images, make sure they're from the public domain.**
