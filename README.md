## Project Format
- The main page "index.html" is where I put general information of water sanitation (already completed).
- Activities page "activities.html" is where I put recommended activities for conserving water. You can put minigames there as well (with Python and pyscript).
- Management page "management.html" is where I put how people have previously, and are still, using water, and how they are being conserved right now (completed).
- Sustainability page "sustainability.html" is where the info about the sustainability of water goes.
