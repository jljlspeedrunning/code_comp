Many use freshwater glaciers, rivers, lakes, hot springs, aquifers, etc. Other sources may use reservoirs with proper health regulations, or the filtration of undrinkable water (such as from an ocean, wastewater treatment facility, etc.). In any way, a reliable source of drinking water (and other uses of water) is important.</h3>
